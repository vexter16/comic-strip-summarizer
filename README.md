# EduComic Pro 🎨📚

EduComic Pro is an AI-powered educational tool that turns complex topics or YouTube videos into engaging, age-appropriate comic strips.

Designed for educators, parents, and students, it uses Google Gemini for storytelling and image generation, and OpenAI Whisper for video transcription.

✨ Features

Multi-Source Input: Generate comics from a simple text topic or by pasting a YouTube URL.

Video Intelligence: Automatically downloads audio, transcribes it locally using Whisper, and extracts key educational concepts.

Age Adaptation Engine :

Toddlers (2-5): Simple words, cute vector art, slow pacing.

Kids (6-10): Fun facts, vibrant cartoon style, dynamic pacing.

Teens (11+): Witty dialogue, manga/anime style, cinematic pacing.

Consistent Characters: Uses an iterative context window to keep visual consistency across panels.

Modern UI: Professional "Dark Mode" studio interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

Live Console: Terminal-style status logs to track the AI's "thought process" in real-time.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend

Framework: FastAPI (Python)

AI Models: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Logic/Plot), Imagen 3 / Gemini Pro Vision (Image Generation)

Audio Processing: yt-dlp (YouTube Download), ffmpeg (Audio conversion), openai-whisper (Local Transcription)

Image Processing: Pillow (PIL)

Frontend

Framework: React (Create React App)

Styling: Tailwind CSS v3

Icons: Lucide React

🚀 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10+

Node.js & npm

FFmpeg (Required for audio processing)

Mac: brew install ffmpeg

Windows: Download & Add to Path

Google Gemini API Key: Get it here

💿 Installation

1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the project root and create a virtual environment:

# Create folder for backend
mkdir backend
cd backend

# Create virtual env
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate


Install the dependencies:

pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart python-dotenv google-genai pillow yt-dlp openai-whisper torch requests "numpy<2.0"


Note: numpy<2.0 is critical to prevent conflicts with the current Whisper library.

Create a .env file in the backend folder:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here


2. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and set up the React client:

# Initialize React app
npx create-react-app comic-frontend
cd comic-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install lucide-react

# Install Tailwind CSS (v3 for stability)
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.1 postcss@8.4.35 autoprefixer@10.4.17


Configure Tailwind:
Ensure tailwind.config.js looks like this:

module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}


Add these lines to src/index.css:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;


🏃‍♂️ Running the App

You need to run the Backend and Frontend in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1: Backend

cd backend
# Make sure your virtual env is active!
python server.py


Server will start at http://localhost:8000

Terminal 2: Frontend

cd comic-frontend
npm start


App will open at http://localhost:3000

🧩 Usage Guide

Select Source: Choose Topic to type a subject manually, or YouTube to paste a video link.

Target Audience: Select the age group. This drastically changes the art style and vocabulary complexity.

Length: Choose how many pages (1-5) you want generated.

Generate: Click the button and watch the "System Log" terminal.

If using YouTube: The system will first download and listen to the video (takes ~30-60s on local machines).

Then: It generates the script and creates images panel by panel.

Export: Once finished, click Export PNG to save your comic strip.

🔧 Troubleshooting

"numpy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.3.5":
Run pip install "numpy<2.0" to downgrade NumPy.

"unable to obtain file audio codec with ffprobe":
FFmpeg is missing. Install it via brew install ffmpeg (Mac) or download the binary (Windows).

"Model does not support response modalities: image":
Ensure server.py is configured to use the correct model for image generation (e.g., gemini-3-pro-image-preview or imagen-3).
